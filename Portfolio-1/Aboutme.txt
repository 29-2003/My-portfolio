 I’m Susmitha, born and brought up in the picturesque village of Muthyalapadu, nestled near small 
 hills in the Rayalaseema region. My village has always been a place of serenity, surrounded by
 nature, which has deeply influenced my outlook on life. I completed my intermediate education in
 Madhapur, Hyderabad, which is not only a significant hub for the IT sector but also exposed me to
 the dynamic pace of urban life.
 
 Currently, I am pursuing my BTech in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the prestigious Indian
 Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna. My academic journey here has honed my technical skills,
 especially in areas like problem-solving, logical thinking, and teamwork, which are essential in my
 field of study.
 
 Outside academics, I have a deep passion for dancing. I’ve participated in numerous events, and it’s
 something that brings me immense joy and freedom. Additionally, I like to doodle whenever
 I get time, translating my random thoughts into creative designs.
 Traveling is another passion of mine. I love exploring new places, immersing myself in different
 cultures and traditions. Each journey teaches me something new and broadens my perspective. I’m also
 particular about the fabrics I wear, appreciating comfort and quality over trends.
 
 One thing that defines me is my love for independence when it comes to work. I feel most confident
 and at ease when I can handle tasks on my own, ensuring that they are done with precision and care.
 My approach to life is rooted in being self-sufficient, while still valuing the collaboration that
 comes with working in teams.
 I am a curious, creative, and determined individual with a passion for engineering, a
 love for the arts, and a keen interest in exploring the world around me.
